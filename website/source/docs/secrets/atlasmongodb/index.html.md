# MongoDB Atlas Secrets Engine

The MongoDB Atlas Secrets Engine generates Programmatic API keys. This allows one to manage the
lifecycle of these MongoDB Atlas secrets programmatically. The created MongoDB Atlas secrets are
time-based and are automatically revoked when the Vault lease expires, unless renewed.

This MongoDB Atlas Secrets Engine supports the creation of Programmatic API keys. Vault will create
a Programmatic API key for each lease that provide appropriate access to the defined MongoDB Atlas
project or organization with appropriate role(s) . The MongoDB Atlas Programmatic API Key Public and
Private Key is returned to the caller. To learn more about Programmatic API Keys visit the
[Programmatic API Keys Doc](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/api/apiKeys/).

## Setup

Most Secrets Engines must be configured in advance before they can perform their functions. These
steps are usually completed by an operator or configuration management tool.

  ~> **Notice:** The following will be accurate after review and approval by Hashicorp, which is in
    progress. Until then follow the instructions in the [README developing section](./../../../../../README.md).


1. Enable the MongoDB Atlas Secrets Engine:

    ```bash
    $ vault secrets enable mongodbatlas
    Success! Enabled the mongodbatlas Secrets Engine at: mongodbatlas/
    ```

    By default, the Secrets Engine will mount at the name of the engine. To
    enable the Secrets Engine at a different path, use the `-path` argument.

2. It's necessary to generate and configure a MongoDB Atlas Programmatic API Key for your organization
   or project that has sufficient permissions to allow Vault to create other Programmatic API Keys.

    In order to grant Vault programmatic access to an organization or project using only the
    [API](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/api/) you need to create a MongoDB Atlas Programmatic API
    Key with the appropriate roles if you have not already done so. A Programmatic API Key consists
    of a public and private key so ensure you have both. Regarding roles, the Organization Owner and
    Project Owner roles should be sufficient for most needs, however be sure to check what each roles
    grants in the [MongoDB Atlas Programmatic API Key User Roles documentation](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/user-roles/).
    Also ensure you set an IP Access List when creating the key.

    For more detailed instructions on how to create a Programmatic API Key in the Atlas UI, including
    available roles, visit the [Programmatic API Key documenation](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/configure-api-access/#programmatic-api-keys).

3. Once you have a MongoDB Atlas Programmatic Key pair, as created in the previous step, Vault can now
   be configured to use it with MongoDB Atlas:

    ```bash
    $ vault write mongodbatlas/config \
        public_key=yhltsvan \
        private_key=2c130c23-e6b6-4da8-a93f-a8bf33218830
    ```

    Internally, Vault will connect to MongoDB Atlas using these credentials. As such,
    these credentials must be a superset of any policies which might be granted
    on API Keys. Since Vault uses the official [MongoDB Atlas Client](https://github.com/mongodb/go-client-mongodb-atlas),
    it will use the specified credentials.

    <!-- ~> **Notice:** Even though the path above is `mongodbatlas/config`, do not use
    your MongoDB Atlas root account credentials. Instead generate a dedicated Programmatic API key with appropriate roles. -->


## Programmatic API Keys

Programmatic API Key credential types create a Vault role to generate a Programmatic API Key at
either the MongoDB Atlas Organization or Project level with the designated role(s) for programmatic access.

  Programmatic API Keys:
  - Has two parts, a public key and a private key
  - Cannot be used to log into Atlas through the user interface
  - Must be granted appropriate roles to complete required tasks
  - Must belong to one organization, but may be granted access to any number of
    projects in that organization.
  - May have an IP access list configured and some capabilities may require an
    access list to be configured (these are noted in the MongoDB Atlas API
    documentation).


1. Create a Vault role for a MongoDB Atlas Programmatic API Key by mapping appropriate arguments to the
   organization or project designated.

  - Organization API Key: Set `organization_id` argument with the appropriate
    [Organization Level Roles](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/user-roles/#organization-roles).
  - Project API Key: Set `project_id` with the appropriate [Project Level Roles](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/user-roles/#project-roles).
  - Create a Organization Key and Assign to a project: creates an Organization
    key and [Assigns]() it to a project, for this `project_id` and `organization_id`
    must be set, with the appropiate [Project Level Roles](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/user-roles/#project-roles).

~> **Notice:** Programmatic API keys can belong to only one Organization but can belong to one or more Projects.

Examples:

```bash
$ vault write mongodbatlas/roles/test \
    organization_id=5b23ff2f96e82130d0aaec13 \
    roles=ORG_MEMBER
```
```bash
$ vault write mongodbatlas/roles/test \
    project_id=5cf5a45a9ccf6400e60981b6 \
    roles=GROUP_DATA_ACCESS_READ_ONLY
```

In both of these examples, after performing a read on `mongodbatlas/creds/test`, for an example of a `read` action
refer to [## Programmatic API Key Access List](#programmatic-api-key-access-list) section.

## Programmatic API Key Access List

Programmatic API Key access can and should be limited with an IP access list. In the following example both a CIDR
block and IP address are added to the IP access list for Keys generated with this Vault role:

```bash
  $ vault write atlas/roles/test \
      project_id=5cf5a45a9ccf6400e60981b6 \
      roles=GROUP_CLUSTER_MANAGER \
      cidr_blocks=192.168.1.3/32 \
      ip_addresses=192.168.1.3
```

Verify the created Programmatic API Key Vault role has the added CIDR block and IP address by running:

  ```bash
    $ vault read atlas/roles/test

      Key                       Value
      ---                       -----
      cidr_blocks               [192.168.1.3/32]
      ip_addresses              [192.168.1.3]
      max_ttl                   0s
      organization_id           n/a
      roles                     [GROUP_CLUSTER_MANAGER]
      project_id                5cf5a45a9ccf6400e60981b6
      roles                     n/a
      ttl                       0s
  ```

  ```bash
    $ vault read mongodbatlas/creds/test

    Key                Value
    ---                -----
    lease_id           mongodbatlas/creds/test/0fLBv1c2YDzPlJB1PwsRRKHR
    lease_duration     20s
    lease_renewable    true
    description        vault-test-1563980947-1318
    private_key        905ae89e-6ee8-40rd-ab12-613t8e3fe836
    public_key         klpruxce
  ```

## TTL and Max TTL

Programmatic API Keys Vault role can also have a time-to-live (TTL) and maximum time-to-live (Max TTL).
When a credential expires and it's not renewed, it's automatically revoked. You can set the TTL and Max TTL for each role
or globally using config/lease.

The following creates a Vault role "test" for a Project level Programmatic API key with a 2 hours time-to-live and a
max time-to-live of 5 hours.

```bash
$ vault write mongodbatlas/roles/test \
    project_id=5cf5a45a9ccf6400e60981b6 \
    roles=GROUP_DATA_ACCESS_READ_ONLY \
    ttl=2h \
    max_ttl=5h
```

This then creates a credential with the lease time-to-live values:

```bash
$ vault read mongodbatlas/creds/test

    Key                Value
    ---                -----
    lease_id           mongodbatlas/creds/test/0fLBv1c2YDzPlJB1PwsRRKHR
    lease_duration     2h
    lease_renewable    true
    description        vault-test-1563980947-1318
    private_key        905ae89e-6ee8-40rd-ab12-613t8e3fe836
    public_key         klpruxce
```

You can verify the role that you have created with:

```bash
$ vault read mongodbatlas/roles/test

    Key                       Value
    ---                       -----
    max_ttl                   5h0m0s
    organization_id           5b71ff2f96e82120d0aaec14
    roles                     [GROUP_DATA_ACCESS_READ_ONLY]
    project_id                5cf5a45a9ccf6400e60981b6
    roles                     n/a
    ttl                       2h0m0s
```

  ~> **Notice:** If you don't set the TTL and Max TTL when you are creating a role the default lease will be used if it
  was previously configured in the `mongodbatlas/config/lease` path. If a default was not created for MongoDB Atlas then
  Vault's default will be used.
